            Denis worked with me on a Salesforce scrum team as a developer for Deloitte Digital for PostNL at the IT, BIT CE department, in the Agile Release Train focusing on business customers. 
            Denis is thoughtful & motivated to do complex novel work and is open about things that need improvement in the team technically. 
            This makes it super pleasant to work with him and I highly recommend him on future assignments! 
            The project had many spikes to find out technical possibilities for how to best personalise the experience for business customers via personalised dashboards through APIs & Plugins. 
            Denis found his way quickly in the new team as he is a self-motivated team player. 
            He did not hesitate in reaching out to other developers from Deloitte in order to overcome impediments and also worked independently on complex user stories.
